Then copy the C++/GameSharing.cpp and C++/GameSharing.h file into your project and you are ready to use GameSharing.\r\nFor more information please take a look at the wiki.\r\n\r\niOS:\r\n\r\nTo use GameSharing on iOS copy the C++ folder into your Classes folder\r\nand add all files inside of the Objetive-C++ folder to your iOS Project.\r\nThen you must change the class definition of AppController to this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>\r\n#import <GameKit/GameKit.h>\r\n#import \"RootViewController.h\"\r\n\r\n@interface AppController : NSObject <UIApplicationDelegate,GKLeaderboardViewControllerDelegate,GKAchievementViewControllerDelegate> {\r\n    UIWindow *window;\r\n}\r\n@property(nonatomic, readonly) RootViewController* viewController;\r\n\r\n@end\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want the \"Done\" buttons inside of the GameCenter UI to work you also need to add this code to the  AppController.mm file:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n- (void)leaderboardViewControllerDidFinish:(GKLeaderboardViewController *)viewController\r\n{\r\n    AppController* delegate = (AppController*) [UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate;\r\n    [delegate.viewController dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES];\r\n    \r\n}\r\n\r\n-(void)achievementViewControllerDidFinish:(GKAchievementViewController *)viewController\r\n{\r\n    AppController* delegate = (AppController*) [UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate;\r\n    [delegate.viewController dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIs my project still compatible with other operating systems if I use GameSharing\r\n===============================================================================\r\n\r\nYes it is. The GameSharing class only compiles the Google Play Games relevant parts, if you compile for android.\r\nOn other operating system all methods just have no effect at all, but won't produce any compiler errors.\r\n\r\nHow to extend GameSharing?\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nAndroid:\r\n\r\nIf you want to add a feature to GameSharing and you know how to develop with the JNI(Java Natvie Interface), you can do \r\nthat. You just have to add a new static function to the AppActvity and write all GPGS code into it. Then add a new function to the GameSharing C++ class and add this code snipped to it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#if CC_TARGET_PLATFORM == CC_PLATFORM_ANDROID\r\n    if(IsGPGAvailable()){\r\n    JniMethodInfo t;\r\n    if (JniHelper::getStaticMethodInfo(t\r\n                                       , \"org/cocos2dx/cpp.AppActivity\"\r\n                                       , \"yourStaticMethodName\"\r\n                                       , \"yourMethodSignature\"))\r\n    {\r\n        t.env->CallStaticVoidMethod(t.classID, t.methodID);\r\n        // Release\r\n        t.env->DeleteLocalRef(t.classID);\r\n    }\r\n    }\r\n    else{\r\n        MessageBox(\"Google Play Games Services are not actvie.\", \"Error\");\r\n    }\r\n#else\r\n    CCLOG(\"No GPGS available on this platform.\");\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\niOS:\r\n\r\nTo add a iOS feature to GamSharing you need to add a static function to the iOS-Only part of GameSharing.h.\r\nThen implement this function in GameCenterHelper.mm, bear in mind that you need to surround a call to your feature with this code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#if CC_TARGET_PLATFORM == CC_PLATFORM_IOS\r\n    //Your code\r\n#endif\r\n```  \r\n=======\r\nRoadmap\r\n=======\r\n\r\nhttps://trello.com/b/lqU4UZTi/gamesharing-roadmap\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\nApache License\r\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\r\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\r\n\r\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n   1.
